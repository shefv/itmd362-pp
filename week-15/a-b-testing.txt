# Production Problem 9: A/B Testing on the Cheap

## The Problem

Locate an interface component on some website that you use frequently that you think could be improved. The improvement should be minor, as we discussed in class.

Take a screenshot of the interface on both a mobile and desktop device. Then, sketch or illustrate your alternate/"b" test. Finally, describe modification and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write in order to conduct the test.

## Deliverables

* Screenshots of the interface component on mobile and desktop, placed in this directory (`week-15`)

* Sketch or illustrate (e.g., in Photoshop) your alternate/"b" test, placed in this directory (`week-15`)

* A text description of the modification, and a description of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write for the test (you do *not* have to write the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however)

The file called desktop-view-solution.png produces an improvement to the desktop view of LinkedIn. I noticed that the Home Page on the mobile view is a clear indication of where the user is. The screenshot illustrates that the heading 'Home Page' is highlighted in blue, as you travel through the other headers, the highlighted functionality follows across. Now, if you look at the desktop-view there isnt a real clear indication of what page the user finds themselves on. I, personally get confused as to if I am on my profile or within a particular thread. The title 'Home Page' is not highlited blue which in turn leaves me a little confused as to what page I am on. Mostly, CSS would needed to be applied here to ensure that the heading is indeed highlighted (similar to the mobile view). Also, should keep in mind to utilize the same exact shade of blue that LinkedIn encorporates throughout their website. This should hopefully reduce confusion.
